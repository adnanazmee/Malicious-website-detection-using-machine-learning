# Malicious-website-detection-using-machine-learning
Python code for detecting malicious website from given dataset



This repository got the following : 
  a.  Dataset
  b.  Code

a.   Datasets : I took the dataset from kaggle, to learn more about the dataset you can visit the link as follow -

b.    Code : The code is wriiten in python , I used three machine-learning algorithm here they are:
                                                          1. Logistic regression
                                                          2. K-NN
                                                          3. Random forest
                                                          
  For visualizing the input data I used seaborn heatmap,pairplot and countplot.                                                        
  I used sklearn metrics accuracy score to first find out the accuracy of my models, then used other
  sklearn metrics like confusion metrics and classification report for showing various accuracy 
  parameters for the models. I got highest accuracy using random forest algorithm.
